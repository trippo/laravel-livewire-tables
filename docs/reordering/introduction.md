You must have [Livewire Sortable](https://github.com/livewire/sortable) or [Livewire Sortable.js](https://github.com/nextapps-be/livewire-sortablejs) installed for this feature.

## A warning about reordering

In order for reordering to work, all rows have to be loaded to the page regardless of if you have pagination on or off. So it's best to only use this feature if you have a small amount of rows to work with.

The table will remember the state if was left in when reordering started and will be returned when reordering ends.
